## Purpose
The primary purpose of this handbook is to act as an essential guide for any development project within our consultancy firm, which operates with more constrained resources compared to a product development house. 

Our focus on promoting best practices and ensuring consistency across our codebase is critical, given our team comprises specialists rather than full-stack developers. 

Each member brings unique strengths to the table, yet faces limitations in their range of capabilities. 

By adhering to a well-defined standard and following our tailored procedures, we mitigate confusion and enable every team member not only to contribute effectively but also to enhance their skills and work more efficiently. 

This approach is pivotal in a consultancy context, where adaptability, precision, and the ability to quickly assimilate and apply shared knowledge can significantly impact the success of client projects. 

Thus, this document is crafted to be a dynamic resource that supports our team's continuous learning and adaptation, fostering a culture of excellence and collaboration that aligns with our consultancy's goals and the diverse needs of our clients.

## Scope
The scope of this handbook is specifically designed to cover the technical and operational guidelines that govern our work in technology projects. 

It is applicable to all members of our team, reflecting our company's flat hierarchy, where collaboration and versatility are highly valued. 

The guidelines detailed within address a range of critical areas, including but not limited to, the use of programming languages, adherence to coding styles, and the implementation of best practices in project setup, testing, documentation, and security. 

This document is pertinent to every project we undertake, ensuring that despite our diverse project requirements and the varied expertise of our team members, there is a cohesive and standardized approach to our development process. 

This alignment is crucial not only for maintaining the quality and consistency of our deliverables but also for facilitating seamless collaboration across our team. 

By clearly defining the boundaries of its application, this handbook aims to streamline our operations and enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of our project execution.
