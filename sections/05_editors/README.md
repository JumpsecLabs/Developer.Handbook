## IDEs

- each member can use the IDE of their own choice, VSCode is preferred

- whatever IDE you are using, it should support the required items from the handbook

As the majority of people use VSCode the following extensions and configuration options are highlighted. Feel free to add any other editor if you and others are using it.

Because the primary IDE should be VSCode, it is also advised to use developer containers. 
This allows for an equal developer experience and code environment. 

[Developer containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) are project specific and should be pushed into the code repository. 

You can look at an [example here](examples/developer_container/README.md).
