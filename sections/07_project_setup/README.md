# Project Setup & Configuration
## Directory Structure
See [Examples](/examples/python/) folder (TBD)

## Dependency Management
### Python
- Preferrably use `poetry` for more than just scripts.
- Use `pip` and `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to store all requirements
- make sure that this comes from a virtual environment and not the global python interpreter
